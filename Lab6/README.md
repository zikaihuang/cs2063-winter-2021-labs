# Lab 6 - AsyncTask

In lecture we've seen the importance of moving long-running operations off of the UI thread and into a worker thread. In this lab you will implement (portions of) this functionality using an `AsyncTask`.

## Understanding the skeleton code

The app will be used to present a list of recent earthquakes downloaded from the United States Geological Survey.
  * This [website](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php) describes a variety of [JSON](http://www.json.org/) feeds that provide information about recent earthquakes
  * We will use data from the feed that provides information about [all earthquakes in the past day](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_day.geojson)

By selecting an earthquake you will be presented with further details about it. On a small device this appears as a separate activity, whereas on a larger device the details are presented alongside the scrolling list.

**Task 1**

1. Download the skeleton project for the lab and review the existing code.
  * This app uses the master/detail flow (MDF) pattern which we briefly saw in lecture 2 and is similar in structure to an app created with the Android Studio Master/Detail Flow template
    * Lecture example can be found [here](https://github.com/hpowell20/cs2063-winter-2021-examples/tree/master/Lecture2/MDFDemo)

  * The MDF pattern employs multiple default layout files to make the UI adapt to different screen sizes and orientations:
    * activity_geodata_detail.xml
    * activity_geodata_list.xml
    * geodata_detail.xml
    * geodata_list.xml
      * geodata_list.xml
      * geodata_list.xml (w900dp)
    * geodata_list_content.xml

* The best way to get your bearings in an existing project file is to navigate to the `AndroidManifest.xml` and determine which `Activity` contains the `<intent-filter>` signifying itâ€™s the `MAIN` `Activity`
  * This `Activity` will be identified by the `android:name` field
  * You can navigate to this Java file and see which layout file it instantiates using `setContentView()`; this will be the first screen users are presented with when this application is run
  * Navigate to the layout file being utilized by `setContentView()` in your `MAIN` `Activity`

* Take a look at this and other layout files in both the Text and Design editors.  
  * Recall that fragments must be hosted by an `Activity`; here those `Activity` layouts are represented by `activity_geodata_detail.xml` and `activity_geodata_list.xml`

* Investigating `activity_geodata_list.xml` we can see it contains `framelayout` which includes the layout `geodata_list`(.xml)
  * Given there are two `geodata_list.xml` files, the Android operating system must decide which layout to present
  * It does this based on screen size (which can be affected by orientation). Here, the layout file containing `w900dp` will be the one used for tablets in landscape mode, allowing both the list of earthquakes and the details of the selected earthquake to be displayed simultaneously side-by-side
  * The layout file without a screen size modifier is the one that will be used for phones.

* Take a look at the phone `geodata_list.xml` layout
  * Inside it we see a single UI element, a `RecyclerView`
  * The `RecyclerView` will be used as a scrolling list of earthquakes that, once selected, will present a detailed description about that particular earthquake
  * Now examine the other `geodata_list.xml` file; it contains a `RecyclerView` and a `FrameLayout` (with id `geodata_detail_container`) that will be programmatically set to contain a `Fragment` representing earthquake details

* Going back to the `GeoDataListActivity` file we'll now explore how fragments get managed based on what screen size we are running on.
  * Notice that `GeoDataListActivity` has a private boolean variable `mTwoPane`
  * This member variable represents whether we are running on a screen size appropriate for displaying both the earthquake list and earthquake details simultaneously
  * If this variable is not `true` we assume we are running on a smaller screen device such as a phone and the Android OS will deliver the layout necessary to fit that screen size
  * If the variable is `true` the Android OS will deliver the layout details necessary to put that user experience into effect

* The `GeoDataListActivity` class `onCreate()` method will instantiate the `MAIN` `Activity`, provide it the described layout in `setContentView()`, and handle managing `Fragment` attachments
  * Because we are designing our application for a positive user experience on both phone and tablet there are some important details regarding how this is accomplished
  * First, notice we instantiate a `FragmentManager`
  * This manager will control which fragments are active in the application based on the logic we provide (in this case, the logic implemented by the MDF template)

* This template checks if the `geodata_detail_container` (which is a `NestedScrollView` UI element in the `activity_geodata_detail.xml`) is `null`
  * If the `geodata_detail_container` is `null` we are in single pane layout (i.e., a phone or tablet in portrait mode)
  * If the `geodata_detail_container` is not `null` we are in a dual pane layout (i.e., a tablet in landscape mode) utilizing fragments

**Task 2**

1. Complete the TODO items in `GeoDataListActivity` and `JsonUtils`.

   * Make sure your app behaves as expected with and without a network connection
   * Ensure that the floating action button (pink button in the bottom right corner) still works while the data is refreshing

NOTES:
* When using a phone it will be difficult to test that your app displays the tablet landscape view correctly (i.e., the list of earthquakes and selected earthquake details side-by-side)
* To see this behavior add a third layout resource file for `geodata_list` corresponding to landscape layout
  * Create a new layout resource directory called `layout-land`
  * Make the file contents the same as `geodata_list.xml (w900dp)`


**Lab Completion**

* Please zip up the source files and submit them to the Lab6 drop box folder on D2L
* Keep a copy of your project work and answers for future reference
