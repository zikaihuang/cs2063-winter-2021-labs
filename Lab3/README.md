# Lab 3 - Activities and Intents

Today’s lab will go deeper into Android Intents by demonstrating how to use explicit and implicit Intents between a couple of Activity classes.

#### Background

For this lab you need to be familiar with how to build an Intent and how to construct and call new Activities:

* http://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/starting-activity.html#BuildIntent
* http://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/starting-activity.html#CreateActivity
* http://developer.android.com/guide/components/intents-common.html
  * This link contains a list of common intents
  * This isn't necessary for pre-lab reading, however, you may find it valuable during this course and any future Android development

#### Objectives

You are given an Android project containing skeleton Activity class files. Your task is to develop a thorough understanding of starting new activities by Intents which was introduced briefly last lab.  We will go deeper into more exploration below.

The Android API Guide succinctly states an "Intent is a messaging object you can use to request an action from another app component" and for that reason they are a very powerful tool for getting feature rich applications running very quickly. We will cover:

* Explicit and implicit Intents
* Passing information with Intents
* Application-specific Intent Filters
* Permissions
* `startActivityForResult()`

The goal of this lab is to create a multiple Activity application that uses multiple explicit and implicit Intents. We'll access activities from within our application as well as request access for activities outside our application.

We'll access camera functionality as well as the capability to send email using existing applications on the device. We'll also explore a potential pitfall if the behavior of the task backstack is misunderstood.

##### Prerequisites

* If you are using an emulator for this lab (e.g., on your own laptop) you'll need to turn on emulated device camera access
  * This can be found under advanced settings when creating an emulated device
* For any device you are using to test this lab (a real phone or emulator) you will need to set up an email account on the device if one is not already set up
  * This can be done on most Android devices via ```Settings → Accounts → Add Account```

#### Intent Types

New Activities are started by passing the ```startActivity()``` method an ```Intent``` parameter
* Intents can be of **explicit** (stated) or **implicit** (implied) nature
* Intents can be sent from an Activity component to start new Activities which was covered in some detail during Lab 2
* Intents can also start Services and Broadcast Receivers (this will be covered in a later lab) as well as be started _by_ Services and Broadcast Receivers

_Explicit Intent_
* Typically used to start a component (e.g.' ```Activity```/```Service```/```Broadcast Receiver```) that exists within your application project; something coded by you or imported for a specified purpose within your application
* It is called explicit because you know the name of the component you intend to use, so you can explicitly announce it to the ```startActivity()``` method, and it will be handled as such

_Implicit Intent_
* If you are calling for a component from another application installed on the device, you may not have knowledge of the component name that you are requesting; you just wish to make use of the component if it’s available on the device
* An application can choose to specify if it contains components that satisfy certain request types by supplying ```Intent Filters``` in their ```AndroidManifest.xml``` file
* By providing such filters, their application can make certain activities available to satisfy some request from other applications. This creates even more modularity in creating application services
* If multiple applications on the device satisfy some request (e.g., to take a photo), a list of possible choices is presented to the user; users can then choose, or not, to have their choice set as default behavior

Investigate the constructors available for building ```Intent``` objects at http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent.html#lfields.
* Take a look at some of the public methods available to Intents
  * Note in particular the various ```putExtra()``` methods
  * The option to attach extra information to an ```Intent``` provides a great way to send data between two Activities
  * By packing an ```Intent``` with extras, its contents can be checked for, and then unpacked, in the receiving ```Activity```
* This is similar behavior to how we attached counter values using ```savedInstanceState``` in ```onSaveInstanceState()``` from ```ActivityOne``` in Lab 2
* Instead of using ```savedInstanceState.put<<some_value_type>>()```, we instead do ```intentName.putExtra(type, value)```.

##### Reminder
* Remember to make habit of adding a ```LogCat``` documentation ```String``` to all Activities and a ```Log.i``` method to each ```Activity``` method for testing purposes!
* Take a look at the API documentation for the [Log](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/util/Log.html) class  and/or ```Lab 2``` Skeleton code for ```ActivityOne```.

##### Initialize Lab Project State

1. Open Android Studio
2. Import the Lab 3 Skeleton project

**Task 1**

Once the project has been imported open the ```ActivityMain``` layout file.  You will notice that the “Start” ```Button``` has not been assigned an ID.

1. Using either the Attributes panel in the Design view or by editing the XML in the Code view assign an ID to the button
2. Programmatically capture a reference to this Start ```Button``` layout component from ```MainActivity``` by assigning it a [setOnClickListener()](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/Button.html) event inside the ```Activity```’s ```onCreate()``` method
   * Take a look at the linked documentation or back to ```ActivityOne``` in Lab 2 if you forget this procedure

**Task 2**

What's the second ```Activity``` class in the project?
* Take note of the Java resource file name.

**Task 3**

With the "Start" button action listener in place we need to give it some Intent functionality.

1. Construct an [Intent](http://developer.android.com/guide/components/intents-filters.html#ExampleExplicit) inside the ```setOnClickListener()``` and use it to start the second ```Activity```
2. View the layout associated with this second ```Activity```
   * There are three buttons: one representing ```Camera``` access, one representing Email access, and one representing a Back ```Button```
  * Give each ```Button``` an ID.

**Task 4**

With the buttons assigned ID values, the next step is to capture references to these buttons.

1. For each button define an
empty ```setOnClickListener()``` which will be used later on
  * The Camera ```Button``` is going to send out an implicit ```Intent``` requesting a ```Camera``` application ```Activity``` that can handle taking photos
  * The Email ```Button``` is going to send out an implicit ```Intent``` requesting an Email ```Activity``` with which to send email
  * The Return ```Button``` will execute an explicit ```Intent``` requesting ```Main Activity```
      * Interesting task backstack implications will be explored from using this approach

Next we will define our application's ```Intent``` to have some function performed on its behalf using implicit intents.

NOTES:
* In Lab 2 we executed an explicit ```Intent``` to start ```ActivityTwo``` from
the ```Context``` of ```ActivityOne```
* When implicitly defining an ```Intent``` we need to pass along an ```Action Constant```
  *  This tells the device how to locate applications that contain an ```Activity``` which is capable of responding to your application's request
  * If a default application ```Activity``` has been set to satisfy that function on the device, it will generally be the ```Activity``` started

**Task 5**

Let's demonstrate this by announcing our application’s ```Intent``` to send an email.
* We don't need to concern ourselves with the underlying method an email application implements to succeed at transferring our message to the recipient
* We need only to announce our intention to send email to the Android operating system and it will inform the user what options are available.

We can provide information to the ```Activity``` we intend to start. This information is sent along with the ```Intent``` as attached extras when we call ```startActivity()``` or ```startActivityForResult()``` with the ```Intent``` we created as a parameter.  This extra information is then usable within the component
(eg. ```Activity```/```Service```/```Broadcast Receiver```) we started.
* A list of possible Actions and Extras available for communicating with email applications on the device as well as email ```Intent``` creation can be found at
http://developer.android.com/guide/components/intents-common.html#Email

For this task we will be implementing your email ```Button```'s ```setOnClickListener()```.
1. Build an email-only ```Intent``` that does not include attachments
   * For testing give your ```Intent``` three extras
        * One for the recipient email addresses (just have one recipient, and make it you)
        * One for the subject line “CS2063 Lab 3”
        * One for the body of the email “This is a test email!”
  * The final email ```Button``` action should be to ```startActivity()``` with your new ```Intent``` as a parameter

**Task 6**

Certain requested components may require access to device hardware; for example: the camera. If your application requests use of a component that in turn will make use of such hardware you must announce that in your application’s manifest file.

1. Edit [AndroidManifest.xml](http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/manifest-intro.html) to include the following:
   * A ```<uses-permission>``` tag to enable writing to external storage (on-device storage that will be used to store photos that have been taken)
    * Additional details can be found at https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/files.html#GetWritePermission
  * A ```<uses-feature>``` tag for the camera
    * Additional details can be found at http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-feature-element.html#declared

**Task 7**

With the required hardware feature to be used declared for the app you can wire your camera ```Button```’s ```setOnClickListener()``` event to implicitly alert the operating system of your ```Activity```'s ```Intent``` to access to the camera functionality. Doing so will provide the user a list of applications to satisfy the request to take a photo.

1. Using the example code from the [Take Photos](https://developer.android.com/training/camera/photobasics.html#TaskPath) documentation as a base implement the Intent used to take a picture and save the full-size photo.  Please note the following.
  * Use the name ```"mobiledev.unb.ca.lab3intents.provider"```  for the authority name in place of ```"com.example.android.fileprovider"``` in both the code and the AndroidManifest.xml file.
  * Create a new resource file at _res/xml/file_paths.xml_ and add the following content:
  ```XML
  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
  <paths>
    <external-path name="my_images"
      path="Android/data/mobiledev.unb.ca.lab3intents/files/Pictures" />
  </paths>
  ```
    * NOTE: The documentation specifies external-files-path, however, this throws an error.  The XML file contents as shown above have been known to work in an emulator and device

**Task 8**

At this point we have saved the photo and we know where it has been saved (HINT: String defined in Task 7 as part of saving the file).  The next step is to alert Android to add this file to the photos database so that other applications (i.e. - the Gallery app) know about it.

1. Add the code for ```galleryAddPic()``` from the [Task Gallery](http://developer.android.com/training/camera/photobasics.html#TaskGallery) link to your code

But where should we call ```galleryAddPic()```?
* We launched our intent to take a photo using ```startActivityForResult()```
* When the activity that is started completes  Android will call our ```Acivity```'s ```onActivityResult``` method
  * Additional details can be found at http://developer.android.com/training/basics/intents/result.html#ReceiveResult

2. Implement ```onActivityResult``` in your ```Activity``` and have it call ```galleryAddPic()``` if it receives the correct request code and result code

**NOTE**
* As of Android 10 the way storage is handled in apps is to use Scoped Storage; as such there is a known issue with the code from Task Gallery in which the image is not saved to the gallery when using devices running Android version 10 and higher
* Provided the camera is invoked from the application and a picture can be taken this is sufficient for the lab as we are concerned with intents functionality

**Task 9**

With the email and camera intents in place we now have to make our back ```Button``` work by implementing an ```Intent``` to explicitly call our ```MainActivity```.
* This is done similarly to how we built and started an ```Intent``` to get from our ```MainActivity``` to ```ExternalActivityCalls```

**Task 10**

With the Intents implemented run the application and perform the following steps:
1. Take a photo
2. Send an email to yourself using the mail button
3. From within the email app attach the photo you just took as an attachment
4. Open the email and take a screenshot of it

**Task 11**

Restart your application and perform the following steps:
1. From the ```MainActivity``` click the Start ```Button```
2. Click the Back button and then Start again
3. Do this a few times
4. Now begin using the device back button to traverse the task backstack.

**Writeup Task**

1. Write a short description of your observations and relate this to what you learned about the task backstack in the previous lab
2. Describe how you could modify the implementation of your ```Activity```'s back button to behave similarly to the device's soft-key back button
3. Add the screenshot of the email sent by your app

**Deliverables**

* Submit `MainActivity.java`, `ExternalActivityCalls.java`, and your answers to the writeup task to the Lab3 drop box folder on D2L
* Keep a copy of your project work and answers for future reference
