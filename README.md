# CS2063 Winter 2021 Labs

This repository contains the labs to be used in the CS2063 Winter 2021 course at UNB.  New labs will be added as the semester goes on.

### Android Studio
* The code examples are built against and run in the 4.1.1 version of Android Studio
* Should you use a different version you will be prompted to update the Gradle plugin used

## Android SDK
* For the most part the code uses API level 26 (Android Oreo 8.0) as a baseline
* Newer versions of the API can be used as well
* Please ensure that the correct SDK platforms are installed for the devices being used for testing

## Lab marking
Each lab will contain a list of deliverables which will need to be submitted upon completion.
